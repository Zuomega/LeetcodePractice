# LeetcodePractice

This is my personal backup of solutions and comparisons on some Leetcode Practice I did.

- I am not a professional Programmer, so the repository is just for later review.

- If you feel it's useful for your study, too, please feel free to fork it.

- First few codes I just put them at top. If I did more, I may try to cluster them into different folders.
