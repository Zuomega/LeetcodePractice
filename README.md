# LeetcodePractice

##### Zuomega



This is the backup of my first-try solutions on some Leetcode Practices.

- Later on I might add some comments here, there is nothing beyond codes yet.

- Since the codes are LeetCode-style, they are not ready-to-run on transistor-based computers. 

- Lucklily you can run all the codes on neuron-based computer of your own.
